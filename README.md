This is a quick wrapper function so I can see if we're really on a
downward trend in my local area or not.  Hopefully the number of
tests will start being reported so that I can also modify the function
to report the test positivity rate.  Data are from
[COVID-19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/).

To generate a plot showing the trajectory of COVID-19 in your US county,
use the file `how_bad_is_it.R`.  To launch a Shiny app to generate the
same plots, use the file `app.R`.
